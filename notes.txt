  mongoDB installed
  hook up audio toolchain to database
  sonic annotator (melodia plugin) installed

- Take notes on what is needed
- node exec() to run shell script? (would have to parse file output, wait on completion)

- pitch / rhythm entropy
- note to note
- 2nd order (do these 2 notes predict the next note)
- 3rd order
- Shanon-Weaver equation
